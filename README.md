# CMU-RPG-Project
Sigma 3 CMU RPG project.
-	This was a senior capstone project where we built an educational RPG.
-	This project was designed to be an educational tool for middle school students and teachers. It would be a game platform that allowed teachers to create a fun and customized assignments. The teachers we contacted about the project saw it as having distinct benefits from the platforms they currently use. They liked the customizability, and they liked the idea of the assignments feeling like an adventure.
-	This project used C# based unity and unity cloud database.
- Here is a video of the project: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXYYoycIsdw
